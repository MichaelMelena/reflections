1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates an .git folder which stores the configuration and snapshots.
I need it in order to use git.
2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It offers selection of changed files. More control over commits.
3) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can add only the files connected to one logical change and commit them and then add other files with other changes after that.
4) What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When I would like to make a change that doesn't necessary depends on the master or it is a change that is experimental.
5) How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps us determine when did the branch separate from master or other branch and where does each branch trace.
