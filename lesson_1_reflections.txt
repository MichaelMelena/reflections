1) How did using a diff helped me to find a bug?
It helped me with pin point the bug.
2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you
a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If i make mistake i can go back and start again from previous point instead of
changing the code back to the way it was or stating from scratch.
3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved,
like Google Docs does?
when versioning manually you can forget to save your file. But when you do not
forget you can choose optimal point for you to save your file.
4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
treat each file separately?
Google docs treat each file separately documents are individual units.
5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view
the history of files?
I can use the log and diff commands to see what and when have changed.
6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
I do not have to be afraid of changing something because i can always revert
the change back to older commit. Which means i can experiment with my code
as much as i want.
7)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git
 for?
 I would like to use it for my network aplication.
